# Basic Idea
I create the inventor from a mock repository which makes it easy to add inventors in the future if more inventors want to use the same platform. i created a Data folder to easy find the interfaces and mock repositories and also the entites from both inventors and the products. I can easy add attributes to the Entites if a want. In the controller i can pick what I want to send to the View method.
